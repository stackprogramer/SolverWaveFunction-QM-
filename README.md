# SolverWaveFunction-QM-
In this project we solve wave function (1D)in Quantum Mechanic for arbitrary potential function(1 dimention) 
in arbitrary boundary and accuracy.
from xstart='  ' to xend='  ' for deltax='  '
this alogorithm solving is in chapter 3 of book Applied Quantum Mechanics: AFJ Levi
